### Environments overview


| Environment | API base URL | Dashboard URL | Chains | SLAs | Webhook origin IP  |
|:-------------|:---------------|:----------------|:--------|:------|:---------------------|
| Production | `api.dfns.io` | [app.dfns.io](https://app.dfns.io/) | <Icon icon="check" /> Mainnet<br/><Icon icon="check" /> Testnet | Yes | `35.181.116.68`  |
| <Deprecated>Staging</Deprecated> | <Deprecated nopill>`api.dfns.ninja`</Deprecated> | <Deprecated nopill>[app.dfns.ninja](https://app.dfns.ninja/)</Deprecated> | <Deprecated nopill><Icon icon="xmark-large" />  Mainnet<br/><Icon icon="check" />  Testnet</Deprecated> | <Deprecated nopill>No</Deprecated> | <Deprecated nopill>`52.47.197.63`  </Deprecated>|


<Warning>

**_The staging environment is to use only with test funds_**

This constraint exists to prevent customers from accidentally moving real funds into the staging environment. Dfns cannot prevent customers from using the staging environment to send funds to a mainnet chain. This is however against our terms of use, so please don't do it - thanks!

</Warning>

### Building API endpoint URLs

Throughout our documentation, assume that you should prepend the environment base URL in front of the API paths given.

For example: `GET /wallets/` should be interpreted as:

* For production:  `GET https://api.dfns.io/wallets/`
* <Deprecated>For staging:    `GET https://api.dfns.ninja/wallets/`</Deprecated>


### Whitelisting webhooks origin IPs

Our webhooks will always be originated from the same IP address (see table above). You can therefore use these if you want to whitelist Dfns IPs for filtering webhook delivery.

Make sure you also verify that webhooks are properly signed by checking the `Dfns-Signature` header as explained in [webhooks documentation](/api-reference/webhooks).
