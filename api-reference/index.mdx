This section is where you can find our complete API reference, including request operations and responses.

## Core objects

Make sure you go through our [core objects documentation](/api-reference/core-objects) to understand the key entities you'll be working with.

## Authentication

This is a key aspect of working with the Dfns API. You'll need to include a token in the headers of your requests to authenticate to all APIs, but also to sign change-inducing requests.
We use passkeys to replace passwords, and you can read all about it in our [authentication documentation](/advanced-topics/authentication).

## API format & HTTP headers

To ensure correct processing of API calls, please follow these conventions

| Header         | Value                 |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| _Content-type_ | `application/json`    |
| _User-agent_   | `<must not be empty>` |



## Rate Limits

Today, current rate limit on our API for a Dfns organisation is:

* if your organisation is on Trial:  100 req/min
* otherwise:  1000 req/min
