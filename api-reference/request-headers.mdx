## Authentication Headers

Most requests to the Dfns API need to be authenticated, and will need to include the following additional headers:

| Header                             | Description                                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;token> | An authentication token (see #get-an-authentication-token) |

## User Action Signature Header

Most requests that change the state within the Dfns system (non-GET requests basically) need to be signed (see [user-action-signing](../../api-docs/authentication/user-action-signing "mention")) by the user's credential, and require the following additional header:

| Header                             | Description                                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-DFNS-USERACTION: &#x3C;user-action-signature> | A one time token you got after the [user-action-signing](../../api-docs/authentication/user-action-signing) flow |

## Registration Headers

Similar to authenticated endpoints, the `Complete User Registration` endpoint needs an authentication token. This token is passed in the `Authentication` header:

| Header                             | Description                                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;token> | The temporary authentication token returned from [#responses](../../../api-docs/authentication/registration/inituserregistration#responses) |
