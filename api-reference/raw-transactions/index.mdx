Signing & Broadcasting transaction enables you to communicate with any arbitrary smart contract of the target blockchain. It can be used to call smart contract functions like mint tokens and even deploy new smart contracts.

You can construct a transaction that performs a complex task and simply have Dfns to sign it using your private key by calling the [signature](/api-reference/keys/generate-signature) endpoint. It will return a signed transaction blob but not broadcast it to the chain.

You can also sign and broadcast it to the chain directly using the [broadcast](/api-reference/wallets/sign-and-broadcast-transaction) endpoint.
