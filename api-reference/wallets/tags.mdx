Tags are a way to add arbitrary metadata to wallets which can be used to [filter them in policy engine](/core-concepts/policies#filters-for-"wallets%3Asign"-activity).  For example, you may want to create deposit wallets which are whitelisted to only send to an omnibus account.  In this case, you could add a tag "\`deposit\`" to each new wallet and then filter a whitelisting policy to just those wallets.
