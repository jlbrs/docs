The Dfns Wallets API enables you to create wallets across a wide variety of chains. APIs are exposed at a high level to view and transfer native cryptocurrencies, fungible tokens and NFTs. Additionally we've exposed low-level transaction broadcast APIs enabling integrations with all available features of the supported chains. All the Tier-1 chains listed below are fully indexed to provide accurate asset reporting and transaction history.

Wallets also support [Delegated Signing](/advanced/delegated-signing), enabling a non-custodial configuration and an "Apple Pay for Crypto" UX via our WebAuthn/Passkeys integrations. If you have feedback on the Wallets API, please send it to [https://support.dfns.co](https://support.dfns.co).

You can use any of the follow enumerated types in the `network` field of [Create Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) and other Wallets API endpoints.

### <Deprecated>Pseudo Networks</Deprecated>

<Deprecated nopill>
  Pseudo-network based unbounded wallet creation is deprecated. For raw key signing, please use the [Signature API](/api-reference/keys/generate-signature) instead.
