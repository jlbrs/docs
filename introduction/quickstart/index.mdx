### How will you use Dfns?

- If your team will **only use the dashboard** and will not use Dfns programmatically, then you can skip steps <Icon icon="5" /> and <Icon icon="6" />. You will be able to create and use wallets for you or for your customers in the dashboard directly.
- If you are building an app for you or for your end users to manage their wallets, then you can skip step <Icon icon="4" /> which is only happening in the dashboard.

### How will you use and control the wallets? Very verry long text here

- Wallets are **for you**:
  - **Custodial**: your Employees will manage the wallets directly, through dashboard or APIs. In this case skip step <Icon icon="6" />.
- Wallets are **for your customers**:
  - **Non-custodial**: your End Users will manage their wallets themselves from within your app. In this case you have build the app and use a service account to interact with the Dfns wallet infrastructure. You can skip step <Icon icon="4" />.
  - **Custodial**: your team will manage the wallets for your customers.
