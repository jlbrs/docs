Your organization is now fully setup, you have invited your team, granted permissions and built policies to secure your business. It's now time to get to work!

This step will show you how to start using wallets in the Dfns dashboard. To read all the details about wallets, head to [wallets](/api-reference/wallets).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new wallet">
    On the dashboard, head to `Operations > Wallets` (direct link: [https://app.dfns.io/v3/operations/wallets](https://app.dfns.io/v3/operations/wallets)), and click "âž• Create a Wallet". In the panel you can select the network out of the [list](/networks) of all supported ones. Give your wallet a name, and optionally add tags for easier recognition (for instance policies can target specific tags). Hit "Create" and ðŸ”‘ sign the action with your passkey.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your wallets">
    A private key is created for you and secured in the Dfns key infrastructure. Your wallet can be used for transactions, using its address displayed on the detailed page. Dfns also starts monitoring transactions on the blockchain to index and display them on the wallet page along with the final balances.
    <Info>
      Tokens are only tracked for Tier-1 blockchain networks. More details [here](/networks/support-tiers).

    Once you have received some assets, scroll down to the relevant one and click "Send" to use Dfns transfer function. You just need to provide the destination wallet address and the amount you wish to send. Hit "Transfer" and ðŸ”‘ sign the action with your passkey.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor your transactions">
    Once you have initiated a transfer, it will be displayed on the wallet page. Look for the transfer Status to understand what is happening to your transaction. See details about the statuses [here](/api-reference/wallets/broadcast-transaction#response-status).
    <Info>
      The "Pending" status means that an approval has been requested by a policy. Ask the approver to go to the Approvals section on the dashboard to accept your transaction!
