Once you have registered in your Dfns org and invited your Users, the next step is to create a Service Account, which you can think of as a machine user. For more details on what service accounts are and when to use them, please refer to [service-account-management](/api-reference/auth/service-accounts).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare a key pair">
    Your service account will need its own key pair to sign its requests. The easiest way to create a Public / Private Key pair is from the command line. You can use the commands shown below or see our [documentation on key generation](/developers/guides/generate-a-key-pair):
    ```sh
# Generate RSA Private Key
openssl genrsa -out rsa2048.pem 2048
# Generate the Public Key
openssl pkey -in rsa2048.pem -pubout -out rsa2048.public.pem
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Service Account">
    Navigate to Settings > Developers > Service Accounts and click "New Service Account". Name the Service Account, copy in the public key (including begin/end lines like `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`), click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù and üîë sign the action with your passkey.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Store your Service Account authentication token">
    The last page shows the masked Service Account JWT. Copy it to a secure location before leaving the page.
    <Warning>
      The token will not be shown later!

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Service Account">
    You now have:
    * A Service Account Token: use it for [authentication](/api-reference/auth/) in all your API requests.
    * A Private/Public key pair: use it to [sign your action](/api-reference/signing-flows) requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Congratulations! You can now make server-side API calls using your service account. Now start building your app using [our Typescript SDK](/sdks/typescript/) and specifically [the Service Account sample app](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/examples/sdk/service-account).

This service account will next be used to log your customers (end-users) in and let them create their own wallets on your organization in <Icon icon="7" />[Non-custody 2/2: customer login and delegated wallets](/introduction/quickstart/7-non-custody-2-2-customer-login-and-delegated-wallets)
