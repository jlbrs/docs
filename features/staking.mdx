### Important Information Regarding Staking Reward Variability

All users should understand that staking rewards, including the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), are dynamic and may fluctuate. Any rate presented in our documentation would be for informational and illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a guarantee of future returns.

The variability in rewards is a fundamental aspect of the network's protocol and is determined by real-time network conditions. These can include, but are not limited to, total network staking participation and validator performance.

To obtain the most precise and current reward information, you may refer directly to the staking provider as listed below. Their platform will reflect up-to-date reward data.
