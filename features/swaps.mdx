  The **Swaps** feature allows you to seamlessly exchange one token for another directly within the Dfns platform—no need to connect to external decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or leave your dashboard. By integrating with leading DEX protocols, Swaps delivers a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience for token trading.

## Why Use Swaps?

- **Stay in One Place:** Swap tokens without leaving the Dfns dashboard, eliminating the friction of connecting wallets to third-party platforms.
- **Best Price Discovery:** Instantly view the best available exchange rates and select from different liquidity venues, so you always get the most value for your trade.
- **Transparent Fees:** See a clear breakdown of all transaction costs—including gas fees, Dfns fees, and DEX fees—before you confirm your swap.
- **Control and Flexibility:** Set your own slippage tolerance to manage price impact and ensure your swaps execute on your terms.
- **Comprehensive History:** Access a detailed record of all your swap transactions, including confirmations and status updates.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support:** Swap assets across chains supported by Dfns[^1]. 
- **Asset Search:** Easily find tokens by name or contract address.
- **Real-Time Quotes:** Get instant quotes for your desired swap, including estimated output and fees.
- **Customizable Slippage:** Default slippage tolerance is set to 0.5%, but you can adjust it as needed.
- **Transaction Transparency:** Review all details before confirming, including minimum received, fees, and estimated gas.
- **Swap History:** Track your past swaps, including both successful and failed transactions.

## How It Works

1. **Select Tokens:** Choose the token you want to swap and the token you want to receive.
2. **Enter Amount:** Specify how much you want to swap.
3. **Review Quote:** Instantly see the best available price, estimated fees, and minimum received.
4. **Set Slippage (Optional):** Adjust your slippage tolerance for added control.
5. **Confirm Swap:** Review all details and confirm your transaction.
6. **Track Status:** Monitor your swap in real time and view your transaction history at any time.

<Note>
If you have a `Wallet:Sign` policy enabled, you will be asked for up to 4 policy approvals (depending on the asset being swapped). Make sure to approve the requests in less than 30 minutes for Uniswap Classic and less than 5 minutes for UniswapX; otherwise, the Swap will expire and fail.
