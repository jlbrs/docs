## What is a Travel Rule

The Travel Rule is a key anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) regulation extended to the cryptocurrency industry. Its fundamental purpose is to increase transparency by requiring Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)—such as crypto exchanges and wallet providers—to collect, verify, and transmit information about the originator (sender) and beneficiary (receiver) for digital asset transfers.

The Travel Rule is now a global standard. Digital asset transactions are expected to meet the same identity-sharing requirements as traditional finance. For VASPs, it’s no longer optional.

Key regions are leading the way:\
🇪🇺 EU: Applies to every crypto transfer\
🇺🇸 US: FinCEN is stepping up enforcement\
🌏 SG, HK, JP: FATF-based rules are in place

Non-compliance can result in fines, suspended licenses, or losing access to banking and payment networks.
