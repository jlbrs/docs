Your organization is now fully setup, you have invited your team, granted permissions and built policies to secure your business. It's now time to get to work!

This step will show you how to start using wallets in the Dfns dashboard.

To read all the details about wallets, head to [wallets](../../api-docs/wallets "mention").&#x20;

{% step %}
### Create a new wallet

On the dashboard, head to Operations > Wallets (direct link: [https://app.dfns.io/v3/operations/wallets](https://app.dfns.io/v3/operations/wallets)), and click ":heavy\_plus\_sign: Create a Wallet".&#x20;

In the panel you can select the network out of the [list](../../../api-docs/wallets#supported-networks) of all supported ones. Give your wallet a name, and optionally add tags for easier recognition (for instance policies can target specific tags).&#x20;

Hit "Create" and :key: sign the action with your passkey.&#x20;

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use your wallets

A private key is created for you and secured in the Dfns key infrastructure. Your wallet can be used for transactions, using its address displayed on the detailed page. Dfns also starts monitoring transactions on the blockchain to index and display them on the wallet page along with the final balances.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Tokens are only tracked for Tier-1 blockchain networks. More details [here](https://docs.dfns.co/d/api-docs/wallets#tier-1-vs-tier-2-support).
{% endhint %}

Once you have received some assets, scroll down to the relevant one and click "Send" to use Dfns transfer function. You just need to provide the destination wallet address and the amount you wish to send.&#x20;

Hit "Transfer" and  :key: sign the action with your passkey.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Monitor your transactions

Once you have initiated a transfer, it will be displayed on the wallet page. Look for the transfer Status to understand what is happening to your transaction. See details about the statuses [here](../../../api-docs/wallets/broadcast-transaction#request-statuses).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The "Pending" status means that an approval has been requested by a policy. Ask the approver to go to the Approvals secrion on the dashboard to accept your transaction!
{% endhint %}
