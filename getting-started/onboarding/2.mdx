{% hint style="info" %}
Some actions here are not directly related to approving transactions, but are required to use the dashboard.
{% endhint %}

Then create and :key: sign the operation with your passkey.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You have successfully created a new permission! It's now usable with any user (employees, service accounts, etc).
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Assign the permission to users

Head back to the users list Org > Users (direct link: [https://app.dfns.io/v3/org/users](https://app.dfns.io/v3/org/users)) and select the user you need to assign the permission to. Click "Add Permission" and select your newly created permission. Confirm and :key: sign the operation with your passkey.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Your user is now able to approve transactions!&#x20;
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### You can now create as many Permissions as you need to enforce the least privilege principle in your organization.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can now head to the next step:&#x20;
