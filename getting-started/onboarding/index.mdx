### How will you use Dfns?
* If your team will only use the dashboard and will not use Dfns programmatically, then you can skip steps 5️⃣ and 6️⃣. You will be able to create and use wallets for you or for your customers in the dashboard directly.
* If you are building an app for you or for your end users to manage their wallets, then you can skip step 4️⃣ which is only happening in the dashboard.

### How will you use and control the wallets?

* Wallets are for you:
  * Custodial: your Employees will manage the wallets directly, through dashboard or APIs. In this case skip step 6️⃣.
* Wallets are for your customers:
  * Non-custodial: your End Users will manage their wallets themselves from within your app. In this case you have build the app and use a service account to interact with the Dfns wallet infrastructure. You can skip step 4️⃣.
  * Custodial: your team will manage the wallets for your customers.
