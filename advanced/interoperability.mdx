Dfns secures private keys by generating them as MPC key shares in our decentralized key management network.  This happens by default when you [create a wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet). 

Our goal is to eliminate all single points of failure (SPOFs) associated with blockchain private keys by never exposing those private keys to anyone.

In some circumstances, however, you may need to import or export an existing wallet and its private key into the Dfns infrastructure, instead of creating a brand new wallet with Dfns and transfer funds to it. As an example, you might want to keep an existing wallet if its address is tied to a smart contract which you don't want to re-deploy.


In such a case, Dfns exposes import and export endpoints. 


## Import a wallet


Use <Post>/wallets/import</Post>: [Import a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/import-wallet)
 in conjunction with our [import SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/examples/sdk/import-wallet).   
 
Note this is intended to be used only to migrate wallets when first onboarding onto the Dfns platform.

<Info>This endpoint is not enabled by default. [Contact support](https://support.dfns.co)  to have it activated.</Info>





<Danger>
**Dfns can not guarantee the security of imported wallets**

We have no way to control who had access to the private key prior to import.  For this reason, this feature is restricted to Enterprise customers who have signed a contractual addendum limiting our liability for imported wallets. 

Please [contact support](https://support.dfns.co) for more information.

## Import a key

Use <Post>/keys/import</Post>: [Import a Key](/api-reference/keys/import-key)
 in conjunction with our [import SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/examples/sdk/import-wallet).

## Export a key

Use <Post>/keys/\{keyId\}/export</Post>: [Export a Key](/api-reference/keys/export-key)
 in conjunction with our [export SDK](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/examples/sdk/export-wallet).

<Danger>
**Dfns can not guarantee the security of exported keys**

We have no way to control blockchain transactions once the single point of failure has been reconstituted.  For this reason, this feature is restricted to customers who have signed a contractual addendum limiting our liability for exported keys.  Additionally, exported keys can no longer be used to sign within the Dfns platform.
