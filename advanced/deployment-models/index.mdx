title: Dfns deployment models
---

At Dfns, we understand that security is not one-size-fits-all. Different organizations have unique requirements for control, compliance, and operational responsibility. That's why we offer several **deployment models** for our MPC signing infrastructure.

A deployment model simply defines **where your wallet's secret key shares are stored and operated**. It determines the balance of responsibility between Dfns and your organization, allowing you to choose the perfect setup for your security posture and business needs.

Whether you prefer a simple and secure hands-off approach or require maximum control over your cryptographic operations, Dfns has a model to match.

### The Models at a Glance

We offer three primary deployment models. Each provides the same core security of our MPC-TSS protocol but varies in operational management and control.

#### Dfns Cloud (Fully-Managed) ‚òÅÔ∏è

This is the standard, default, and most popular option. In this model, Dfns securely manages all the key shares within our robust, geographically distributed cloud infrastructure. It's a turnkey solution that provides institutional-grade security with zero operational overhead for your team.

- **You get:** Maximum convenience and the full security of the Dfns platform without managing any infrastructure.

#### Hybrid Cloud ü§ù

The Hybrid model offers a powerful balance of control and convenience. Dfns manages a portion of the key shares in our cloud, while your organization securely holds one or more shares within your own environment. This makes you a required participant in every signing ceremony, giving you a direct cryptographic veto over any transaction.

- **You get:** Shared security responsibility and direct control over transaction finality.

#### On-Premise (Self-Hosted) üè¢

For organizations with the strictest data residency, compliance, or infrastructure requirements, we offer a fully on-premise deployment. In this model, you run the Dfns signing software and manage all key shares entirely within your own data centers or private cloud.

- **You get:** Maximum control over your keys and infrastructure.


### Enhancing Security with On-Premise HSMs üõ°Ô∏è

For organizations seeking the highest level of assurance, Dfns supports integrating customer-owned **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**. Customers using the **Hybrid Cloud** or **On-Premise** models can store their key shares within their own FIPS 140-2 compliant HSMs.

This adds a layer of physically-enforced, tamper-resistant security to your cryptographic operations, ensuring your key shares never leave the protected boundary of your hardware.


### Choosing the Right Model for You

The best model depends on your specific needs for control versus convenience. The table below outlines the key differences to help you decide.
