Log into your Dfns dashboard and click **Settings=>Exchanges=>New**.  Select "Binance" and copy the API and Secret keys from above into the corresponding fields for the Read credentials. 

Go back to Binance and generate a second Write API key by following the same steps as outlined above.  Next click "Edit Restrictions" in the top right, then select the radio button at the bottom for "Restrict access to trusted IPs only (Recommended)".  Enter 35.181.116.68 and push return.  Finally check the box for "Enable Withdrawals" and click "Save".
