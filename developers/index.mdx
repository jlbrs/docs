---

Welcome to Dfns! This guide will walk you through the foundational authentication concepts you need to start making API calls. Understanding how Dfns handles security is the key to a successful integration.

The core of our security model relies on a two-token system for sensitive operations: an **`Authentication Token`** to authenticate your application, and a **`User Action Signature`** to prove end-user consent.


## üîë Token 1: The Login Token

The `Authentication Token` is like your API key, proving that requests are coming from a legitimate source. You must include this token in the `Authorization` header for every API call.

### How to Get It

Follow one of the [authentication flows](/api-reference/auth/login-flows). The easiest way: create a service account and use it in your backend to call our API. 

This token answers the question: "**Is my application allowed to talk to Dfns?**"

<Info>
  For a step-by-step guide on creating credentials and generating your first token, see the [Dfns API using a service account](/introduction/quickstart/6-non-custody-1-2-dfns-api-using-a-service-account) tutorial.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Token 2: The User Action Signature

For any sensitive operation ‚Äîlike creating a key, initiating a transaction, or registering a wallet‚Äî you need a second token. The `User Action Signature` is a signed challenge that proves a user with a registered passkey has explicitly approved the action.

This token is sent in the `X-DFNS-USERACTION` header and is required for most `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.

Think of it like a bank transaction:
* The **`Authentication Token`** is the bank teller's ID, allowing them to access the banking system.
* The **`User Action Signature`** is the customer's signed withdrawal slip, authorizing a specific transaction.

The teller needs both to release the funds. Similarly, Dfns requires both tokens to ensure that a request is not only from a trusted application but is also explicitly authorized by the asset owner.

This token answers the question: "**Did the user consent to this specific action?**"
