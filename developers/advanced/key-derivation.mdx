Dfns decentralized key management network supports threshold Diffie-Hellman protocol based on [GLOW20 paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/096). You can use the DH protocol to derive output from a domain separation tag and a seed value. The derivation process is deterministic, i.e. the same Diffie-Hellman key and seed will lead to the same derived output. To ensure reproducibility, we use hash to curve [RFC9380](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9380.html) and standard ciphersuite `secp256k1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_`.

<Info>
The seed doesn’t need to be secret. Without access to the DH key, it is not possible to do the derivation, even if the seed is known. Moreover, if both seed and derived output are known, it’s also not possible to do the derivation for another seed without having access to the DH key.
</Info>

The derivation endpoint only supports Diffie-Hellman keys. Regular threshold signature keys, like ECDSA or EdDSA, will not work. You can create a Diffie-Hellman key with the [Create Key](/api-reference/keys/create-key) endpoint using `scheme=DH` and `curve=secp256k1`.

Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/keys/derive-key) for more details about the endpoint.
