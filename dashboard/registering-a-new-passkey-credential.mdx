Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to sign in to your Dfns account and approve actions without needing to enter a password.

<Info>
**What is a Passkey?**

A passkey is a digital credential, like a key to a house, that is stored on your device (computer, phone, or hardware security key). It replaces traditional passwords with a more secure, phishing-resistant authentication method using biometrics (like Face ID or a fingerprint) or a device PIN.

Read more about passkeys on the dedicated page: [why-dfns-uses-passkeys](/core-concepts/passkeys)
</Info>

Adding multiple passkeys is a recommended security practice. For example, you can register one passkey on your primary computer and another on a Yubikey, ensuring you always have a way to access your account.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

* An active Dfns account with permissions to manage your own security settings,
* Access to the Dfns Dashboard using an existing credential,
* The physical device (computer, Yubikey) on which you want to create and store the new passkey.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to register a new passkey to your Dfns account.

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in and Navigate to Credentials">

Navigate to the Dfns Dashboard and head to Settings > Authentication > Credentials. Direct link: [https://app.dfns.io/v3/settings/authentication/credentials](https://app.dfns.io/v3/settings/authentication/credentials)

You can see here the list of existing credentials, notice the checkbox to activate/deactivate each one of them. This can be useful in case you lost a device for example.

</Step>

<Step title="Name the new Credential">

Click the "**Create Credential**" button and give a name to the new credential.

<Info>
**Pro Tip:** Use clear and specific names to easily distinguish your passkeys.

For example: `MacBook Pro (Work)`,  `Backup Yubikey`, or `Google Titan Key`...

</Step>

<Step title=" Register your passkey as the new Credential">

Click the "**Create Credential**" button.

Your browser (or your password manager) will now take over and prompt you to create a new access key for `dfns.io`. This step will vary depending on your operating system and browser (e.g., Windows Hello, Apple Touch ID/Face ID, Android fingerprint).

Use your new device's security method to confirm. This could be:

* **Biometrics:** Fingerprint scan, Face ID, etc.
* **PIN:** Your device's local PIN code.
* **Hardware Key:** Tapping a connected YubiKey or other FIDO2-compliant security key.

Follow the browser prompts until your key is created.

</Step>

<Step title=" Sign your request with an existing Credential">

Your new passkey has submitted the credential, you just have to save it now.

Click "**Save Credential**" and :key: sign the action with your existing passkey.

<Check>
Congratulations! Your new passkey has been successfully added to your Dfns account. It will now appear in your list of registered passkeys under the **Credentials** tab. You can now use this passkey to log in to Dfns and approve policy-controlled actions.
</Check>

### Troubleshooting

* **"Create Credential" button is not visible:** This may be a permissions issue. Please contact your Dfns organization administrator to ensure your role has the necessary permissions.
* **The browser prompt does not appear:** Ensure you are using a supported browser and that it is updated to the latest version. Check if any browser extensions or pop-up blockers are interfering with the process.
* **Authentication Failed:** If your biometric or PIN authentication fails, simply try again. Ensure your finger is clean for fingerprint scanners or that you are entering the correct PIN for your device.
