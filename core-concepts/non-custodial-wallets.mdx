Dfns enables a unique configuration called **Delegation** in which control of a wallet is delegated from your team to your end user (regardless of whether they are a consumer or a corporate entity). 

Your users will have to sign actions (transfers, etc.) themselves using their own passkeys, from your app or website: you and your team lose control of the wallet, and your end users gain full control.

## White-label Dfns

Delegation allows you to hide the fact that your users are using Dfns as their wallet provider and only use our API for wallet management, in the background. 

Using Delegated user management, you register your end users and then log them in to Dfns from your own backend when they need to interact with their wallets. This is only a backend authentication, the users don't see anything of Dfns, we just tell you what to show and ask them, for instance when they actually have to sign an action using their passkey.

In this way, you retain full control over the user experience, and Dfns remains hidden in the backend.  No email from Dfns, no Dfns branding, just your app and your brand.

<Info>
End Users are a first class citizen in Dfns. Once registered (by you) they could use the Dfns APIs directly if they access their auth token. Please carefully review the policies and controls you have in place.
