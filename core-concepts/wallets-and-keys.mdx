## Wallets

The Dfns Wallets API enables you to create wallets across a wide variety of chains. APIs are exposed at a high level to view and transfer native cryptocurrencies, fungible tokens and NFTs. Additionally we've exposed low-level transaction broadcast APIs enabling integrations with all available features of the supported chains. All the Tier-1 chains listed below are fully indexed to provide accurate asset reporting and transaction history.

Wallets also support [Delegated Signing](../advanced-topics/delegated-signing), enabling a non-custodial configuration and an "Apple Pay for Crypto" UX via our WebAuthn/Passkeys integrations. 

Check out the list of networks we support [here](/networks/).

## Keys

The Dfns Keys API enables you to sign complex transactions for any Bitcoin compatible, EVM compatible or other alternative L1 blockchains that Dfns supports. This API enables integration with hundreds of blockchains and ecosystems, for example

* Use Dfns keys with hundreds of blockchains in the EVM, Cosmos, or Polkadot ecosystems that Dfns doesn't directly integrate with.
* Use Dfns keys with blockchains Dfns doesn't natively support, like Starknet, as long as they use one of the supported key formats.
* Use Dfns keys with private blockchains that Dfns doesn't have access to, such as Polygon Supernets or Avalanche Subnets.

Keys also support [Delegated Signing](../advanced-topics/delegated-signing), enabling a non-custodial configuration.
