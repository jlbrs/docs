title: 'Dfns Security Model'
description: >-
    Our security model is built on a simple but powerful idea: **the best way to protect a secret is to ensure no single person or system ever knows it.** 
    At Dfns, we've designed our entire platform around this principle, eliminating single points of failure to provide mathematically provable and layered security for your digital assets.

### Cryptographic Core: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) üîê

The biggest risk in digital assets has always been the **private key**‚Äîa single piece of data that can unlock and control all your funds. Our platform eliminates this risk by using **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
1.  **No More Private Keys**: When you create a Dfns wallet, a complete private key is **never generated**. Instead, a distributed protocol creates multiple secret "key shares."
2.  **Distributed Security**: Each key share is stored on a separate, independent, and isolated server. These servers are geographically and logically separated from one another to prevent collusion.
3.  **Collaborative Signing**: To approve a transaction, a required number of these servers (a quorum) collaborate. They use their individual shares in a sophisticated cryptographic protocol to produce a valid signature **without ever combining the shares or revealing the private key**.

This means there is no single secret to steal. An attacker would need to breach multiple secure, independent systems at the exact same time, which is practically impossible.


### Driven by Cutting-Edge Research üî¨

Our leadership in cryptography is no accident. Dfns is powered by a dedicated, in-house **research team** composed of world-class cryptographers and security engineers.

This team is at the forefront of MPC and digital asset security, responsible for:
* **Designing Novel Protocols**: Developing and implementing proprietary, state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols that enhance security and performance.
* **Publishing Academic Research**: Contributing to the broader security community by publishing peer-reviewed papers and advancing the field of applied cryptography.
* **Continuous Vetting**: Constantly analyzing the threat landscape and stress-testing our own systems to stay ahead of future vulnerabilities.

This commitment to fundamental research ensures our security model is not just robust today but is built to withstand the threats of tomorrow.

### Authentication: Passwordless & Phishing-Resistant üõ°Ô∏è

Securely storing keys is only half the battle; user access must also be ironclad. Dfns eliminates the risks of traditional passwords by using **Passkeys**, built on the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard.

* **No Phishable Credentials**: Passkeys create unique cryptographic credentials on your device (like your phone or laptop). There are no passwords to be stolen, forgotten, or phished.
* **Built-in 2FA**: This method natively incorporates two-factor authentication, using something you have (your device) and something you are (your biometric data like a fingerprint or face scan) to prevent impersonation.
* **Secure Recovery**: Users can add multiple devices and recovery passcodes to their accounts, ensuring they never lose access.


### Governance & Policy Enforcement ‚öñÔ∏è

Technology alone isn't enough. Human error is a major security risk, which is why we built a powerful and flexible **Wallet Entitlement Management (WEM)** policy engine. This acts as a programmable rulebook for your wallets.

You can enforce strict, automated rules *before* any transaction is even signed, such as:
* **Approval Quorums**: Require multiple team members to approve high-value transactions.
* **Address Whitelisting**: Only allow transfers to pre-approved, trusted addresses.
* **Velocity Limits**: Set limits on transaction amounts or frequency to prevent unauthorized drainage of funds.

This layer of security moves governance from manual checklists to automated, code-enforced rules, dramatically reducing the risk of both internal and external threats.


### Audits, Certifications, and Compliance üìú

Trust must be earned and verified. We are committed to transparency and adhere to the highest industry standards, validated by continuous third-party audits and certifications.

**Certifications:**
* **SOC 2 Type II**: This certification affirms that our information security practices, policies, and procedures meet rigorous standards for security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy.
* **ISO 27001**: An international standard for information security management, demonstrating our commitment to a systematic and robust security program.

**Continuous Audits & Penetration Testing:**
Our platform, including our MPC libraries, authentication services, and infrastructure, is regularly audited and tested by leading security firms like **Kudelski Security, Halborn, and Redacted**. These engagements include:
* Whitebox and Blackbox Penetration Tests
* Cryptographic Library Audits
* Full Security Model Reviews

**Compliance-Ready Platform:**
We provide the tools to help you meet your regulatory obligations, including:
* **AML/KYT Integrations**: Real-time transaction monitoring with partners like **Chainalysis** and **Elliptic**.
* **Travel Rule Support**: Integrations to help you comply with global data transfer regulations.
