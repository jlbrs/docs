description: Policies enable businesses to enforce rules and request approvals on top of actions taken using the Dfns API.
---

A Policy acts as a "gate" for a given activity in Dfns system, which enforces a set of rules before the activity is executed. If triggered, a policy can either block the activity or launch an approval process before finalizing the activity.

Policies are used as part of risk management, information security, or other compliance functions.

The policy Engine allows you to create a policy, specifying the conditions that will result in an approval being triggered, as well as the approval groups whose approval will be required.  For example:

As a compliance officer, you have to implement these new processes:

1. For payments over \$100,000, request approval from a Vice President.
2. For payments over \$250,000, request approval from both a Vice President and a Managing Director.

To do that you will have to create two Policies:

* **Large Payment**:
  * Rule: `TransactionAmountLimit` with amount value of \$100,000.
  * Approval scoped to VicePresidents.
* **Very Large Payment**:
  * Rule: `TransactionAmountLimit` with amount value of \$250,000.
  * Approval scoped to ManagingDirectors.

When a policy is triggered, it generates an approval request, which must be either approved or rejected by members of the corresponding approval group.  Here's a schematic of the Policy Engine entity model:

<Warning>
  **Requesters cannot approve their own requests.**

  If the requester is also required for the approval group quorum, then the request will be forever blocked.

## Get Started

Check out how to create a policy [using the dashbaord](/guides/creating-policies) or [using our API](/api-reference/policies). Then see how to [approve](/guides/approving-transactions) them.
