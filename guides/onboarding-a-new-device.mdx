## 1. On the existing device

On the connected device, head to [Settings > Credentials](https://app.dfns.io/v3/settings/authentication/credentials) and click "Get Cred. Code".

Validate the action using your existing passkey.

A 9-character code is displayed. Note that this code is only valid for 60 seconds.

## 2. On the new device

Open [https://app.dfns.io/login/credentials/code](https://app.dfns.io/login/credentials/code) in your browser.

Enter your email and the code you received on the first device.

Then register you passkey on that new device.

Now both devices can be used to access the dashboard!
