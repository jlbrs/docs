  **Key Takeaways:**
  - **Users** are individuals invited to your Dfn's organization.
  - **Permissions** are collections of operations that a user can see and do.
  - **Best Practice:** Grant users the minimum permissions necessary for their job (principle of least privilege).

## Managing Users

You can easily invite new team members to your Dfns organization and manage their access directly from the dashboard.

### Inviting a New User

To add a new member to your team:

1.  Navigate to **Users**.
2.  Click the **New User** button in the top-right corner.
3.  Enter the user's **email address**.
5.  Click **Create**.

The user will receive an email invitation to join your Dfns organization. 
They are created without any permission to do or see anything. You should then assign permissions to them. 



### Deactivating a User

If a team member no longer requires access, you can deactivate their account. Deactivating a user immediately revokes their access to the Dfns dashboard and their ability to use API credentials associated with them.

1.  Navigate to **Users**.
2.  Find the user you wish to remove in the list.
3.  Click the <Icon icon="trash"/> icon.



## Managing Permissions with Roles

Permissions allow you to define granular permissions and apply them consistently to different users. This approach simplifies access management and enhances security.

### Creating a Custom Role

Dfns provides default permissions like `DfnsFullAdminAccess` (which is applied when you set someone as an Admin), but we highly recommend creating custom permissions tailored to your team's specific responsibilities.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Permissions**.
2.  Click **New Permission**.
3.  Give the permission a descriptive **Name** (e.g., "Approver", "Auditor", "Transaction Operator").
4.  Select the specific **Operations** you authorize for this permission. Each operation is broken down by action (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`) and resource (`Wallets`, `Policies`, etc.).
5.  Click **Create** to save the new permission.



### Assigning Roles to Users

You can assign or change a user's roles at any time.

1.  Navigate to **Users**.
2.  Click on the user you wish to edit.
3.  In the **Permissions** section, you can add or remove permissions from the user's profile.
4.  Changes are saved automatically.



## Recommendations & Best Practices

Adhering to the **principle of least privilege** is crucial for security. Each user should only have the permissions essential to perform their duties. Avoid using the broad `Admin` role for daily operations.

See an example with an "Approver" permission in the [Permission-Based Access Control](/guides/permission-based-access-control) tutorial.
