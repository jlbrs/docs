At Dfns, we believe in rewarding our customers for participating in the ecosystem. We recently became a featured application on Canton, which enables you to pay for your Dfns wallet subscription using the Canton Coins earned by running your validator.

### **How It Works**

Protocol-level rewards, earned via your activity and validator participation, are passed back to you automatically. 

These rewards can be first applied to offset your monthly Dfns subscription fee. Once your full monthly fee is covered, any additional rewards earned during the billing cycle are shared with you based on your subscription tier.

<Note>
Note that the rewards are determined by network usage and are not in Dfns control.

### **How to get started**

To get started with paying Dfns in Canton Coin, Dfns needs to configure your account and provision a Canton payment contract. When ready we will send it to you for acceptance. Once accepted, billing will be done via Canton Coin.
