title: Using Networks' Testnets

### What Is a Testnet?

A **testnet** is a blockchain network used for testing purposes. Unlike the mainnet, transactions on testnets use **test tokens**, which have no real-world value.

Examples of popular testnets:

* Ethereum Goerli / Sepolia
* Polygon Mumbai
* Bitcoin Testnet
* Avalanche Fuji

The list of all supported testnets can be found on [#supported-networks](../../api-docs/wallets#supported-networks "mention")

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Wallet for a Testnet">

You can create a wallet for a specific blockchain and network using the Dfns dashboard:

Head to Operations > Wallets and click ":heavy\_plus\_sign: Create a Wallet".&#x20;

Select a testnet network from the list (e.g. StellarTestnet) and give a name (e.g. "Stellar Testnet Wallet") and click Create. Finally, :key: sign the operation with your passkey and you obtain your new wallet!


</Step>

<Step title="Get test funds">

Once your wallet is created:

* Go to a **faucet** (test token distributor) for your chosen testnet.&#x20;
* Provide your Dfns wallet address, visible on the "Address" field on your wallet page
* Receive test tokens for development.

**Example Faucets are listed on** [#supported-networks](../../api-docs/wallets#supported-networks "mention")


</Step>

<Step title="Check Wallet Balance">

On your wallet page, the new assets/coins balance should be updated quickly.&#x20;

You can also check that balance using the API: [get-wallet-by-id](../api-docs/wallets/get-wallet-by-id "mention")


</Step>

<Step title="Send a Test Transaction">

Now that your wallet has test tokens, you can initiate a transaction.

Youâ€™ll need to approve the transaction via your usual Dfns approval flow (e.g., :key: passkey, custom policy, etc.).

You can then monitor the status on the wallet page. Once the transaction has been confirmed then it has been validated on the blockchain and is final.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security Considerations**

* Do not reuse testnet wallets for mainnet usage.
* Treat API keys and credentials securely, even in test environments
* Use approval policies for transaction verification even in test mode.
</Warning>
