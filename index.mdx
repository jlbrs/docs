Welcome to the Dfns APIs! Dfns provides wallet-as-a-service infrastructure that enables crypto developers to forget about private key management so they can focus on building what matters most â€” their applications. Weâ€™ve hired teams of security and cryptography PhDs to build the industryâ€™s leading _Secure Multi-Party Computation_-based _Threshold Signature Scheme_ ([MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)/[TSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem)) implementation so that you donâ€™t have to.

If youâ€™re just getting started with Dfns APIs, head to our [**Getting Started**](/introduction/quickstart) section to learn about our nomenclature and API conventions.

If you need details on a specific API endpoint, peruse our [API Reference](/api-reference) reference section for details on headers, query parameters, body parameters, response types, etc.

Donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](https://support.dfns.co) if you have any questions about the APIs. Our documentation is a humble work in progress and your constructive feedback is always appreciated. So please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks!
