Before reviewing our support matrix, it's important to understand how Dfns exposes APIs for facilitating blockchain interactions. See more details [here](/features/transactions). 

When using the high-level [Transfer API](/api-reference/wallets/transfer-asset), Dfns supports various assets across multiple chains, such as native cryptocurrencies, ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, and non-EVM assets. In the Dfns API, the `kind` variable specifies the type of asset being transferred. It determines how the transaction is processed based on the asset's blockchain standard. For example, `kind` can be set to `Native` for base cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), `ERC20` for fungible tokens on Ethereum, or `ERC721` for NFTs. Other possible values include standards from non-EVM chains like `SPL` or `ASA`. Correctly setting the kind ensures that the API handles the transaction according to the asset's unique characteristics.

Please refer to the list of supported assets standards here for each network: [Supported Networks](/networks).

Each asset type requires specific parameters, such as contract addresses for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, or asset IDs for non-EVM assets. Transactions involve specifying the asset type, destination address, and amount, with additional fields varying by asset type.
