We plan to add support for more blockchain networks over time. The supported features will vary depending on popularity and market demand.

## Tier-1 blockchain networks

Tier-1 blockchain networks support all wallet features, including automatic detection of wallet [asset](wallets/get-wallet-assets) and [NFT](wallets/get-wallet-nfts) balances if applicable, and on-chain asset transfer [history](wallets/get-wallet-history). Tier-1 support also include [transfer asset](wallets/transfer-asset), [broadcast transaction](wallets/broadcast-transaction) and [generate signature](wallets/generate-signature). Tier-1 chains also support [Webhooks](webhooks) driven by chain indexing.

## Tier-2 blockchain networks

Tier-2 blockchain networks do not track tokens or on-chain history. Only the [balance](wallets/get-wallet-assets) of the native token, which is used to pay transaction fees, is returned. Tier-2 support includes [Broadcast Transaction](wallets/broadcast-transaction), [Generate Signature](wallets/generate-signature), and Transfer Asset for native chain cryptocurrency only. Webhooks are not available for Tier-2 chains.
