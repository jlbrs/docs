**Attention: This project is currently in BETA.**

This means that while we've worked hard to ensure its functionality, stability, and security, there may still be bugs, performance issues, or unexpected behavior.
</Warning>


For developers using this hybrid mobile framework from Google, we have a Dart compatible SDK available [here](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-flutter).


## Installation
