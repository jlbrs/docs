## Concepts

### `PasskeysSigner`

All state-changing requests made to the Dfns API need to be cryptographically signed by credentials
registered with the User.

> **Note:** To be more precise, it's not the request itself that needs to be signed, but rather a "
> User Action Challenge" issued by Dfns. For simplicity, we refer to this process as "request
> signing".

This request signature serves as cryptographic proof that only authorized entities are making the
request. Without it, the request would result in an Unauthorized error.

While implementing an Android application your backend server will have to communicate with the DFNS API to retrieve this challenge and pass it to your application, `PasskeysSigner` will be used to register and authenticate a user.

```
val passkeysSigner = PasskeysSigner(context, RelyingParty(id, name))
```

#### Register

```
val fido2Attestation = passkeysSigner.register(challenge)
```

#### Sign

```
val fido2Assertion = passkeysSigner.sign(challenge)
```
