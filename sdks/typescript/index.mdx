title: 'Typescript SDK'
---

The Dfns Typescript SDK offers utilities to help Typescript developers get Dfns up and running more quickly. It automatically populates all the [required headers](/api-reference/auth) and implements the cryptography for request signing. 

This is a full SDK implementation which includes strongly typed function definitions which should enable IntelliSense in an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

Simply install `@dfns/sdk` in your node environment: 

```bash
npm i @dfns/sdk
```

**Requirements:**
- Node version 18 or more recent. 

## React Native

We've built specific bindings for React Native into the Typescript SDK to help accelerate hybrid mobile development projects predicated on this popular framework.  Please see [the React Native section here](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/packages/sdk-react-native) for more details.
